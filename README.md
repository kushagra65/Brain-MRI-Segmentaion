# Brain Tumor Detection in MRI Scans

This project leverages machine learning techniques to detect and segment tumors in MRI scans of the brain. The goal is to assist medical professionals by providing accurate and automated tumor detection from MRI images.

## Project Overview

Brain tumors can be life-threatening and require accurate diagnosis and timely intervention. This project focuses on using deep learning algorithms to analyze MRI scans and identify the presence of tumors. The system is trained using a dataset of brain MRI images, specifically designed for tumor segmentation tasks.

### Key Features:
- **Automated Tumor Detection**: Utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning models for identifying and segmenting brain tumors in MRI scans.
- **FLAIR Abnormality Segmentation**: The model is trained to recognize abnormalities in FLAIR (Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery) MRI sequences, which are crucial for detecting tumors.
- **High-Accuracy Models**: The models are fine-tuned for high sensitivity and specificity in tumor detection.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains brain MRI images and corresponding manual FLAIR abnormality segmentation masks. The images were sourced from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) and represent 110 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lower-grade glioma collection. Each patient has at least one FLAIR sequence and associated genomic cluster data available.

### Dataset Contents:
- **MRI Scans**: Brain MR images in FLAIR sequence.
- **Segmentation Masks**: Manual annotations highlighting tumor regions.
- **Patient Data**: Genomic clusters and additional patient information provided in `data.csv`.

### Accessing the Dataset:
To use this dataset, please ensure you have the appropriate permissions and follow any licensing agreements associated with The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA).
